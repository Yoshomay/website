Source code for my website https://www.yoshomay.com

The source code is honestly a mess, mostly cus the way it's organized works for me, and no one else works on the site anyways so whatever.
The js sucks im well aware i suck at js lol. I also use sass instead of css so that way i can have inline comments, so you'll need a sass compiler (or just use the compiled .css files).  



TODO:
Make the popups on /art be more legible and take up less of the screen

Add more themes (Zorin OS Dark, maybe more ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
