Source code for my website https://www.yoshomay.com
Discord server link:  https://www.discord.gg/nJ8uY7wwJY

The source code is honestly a mess, mostly cus the way it's organized works for me, and no one else works on the site anyways so whatever.
The js sucks im well aware i suck at js lol. I also use sass instead of css so that way i can have inline comments, so you'll need a sass compiler (or just use the compiled .css files).  



TODO:
Make the popups on /art be more legible and take up less of the screen

Make the theme still work on 404 pages in directories that aren't the top level (eg yoshomay.com/aa/aaa)

make the myfursona grid not be a grid when using the legacy theme (like how it used to look like in 5.x)

Add more themes (https://www.yoshomay.com/css/themeIdeas.txt)
