* Made the css files and theme.js load in using absolute paths not relative paths (/css/theme.css instead of css/theme.css), so that way 404 pages like yoshomay.com/asdf/asdf will now display correctly.
* Made the grid s on /myfursona and /art not be grids when using the Legacy theme (to be accurate to how it was back then pre 6.0)
* Actually fixed the youtube embedds on /myfursona
* Made the popups on /art have the current theme's background, and everything behind it transparent to make it more legible from the main page
* Made the popups on /art closeable by clicking the background
* Removed the resize handles from the /art and /myfursona grids
* Added Zorin OS Dark Theme
* Made the theme menu not be so low down on the goldsrc theme
