* Fixed the redirect on /samyo to go to https://samyofox.ninja/yosho not yoshomay.rf.gd/samyofox.ninja/yoshomay
* Made the box on My Links and 404 smaller
* Changed the tab icon on /samyo from the website's icon to Samyo's pfp
* Tried to add adaptive scaling on everything
* Scaled my pfp to 400px x 400px instead of 406x406 to make scaling with % easier

*Made some changes to the code to make it more clean
	Made all the div's into one .css file instead of a .css file for every page
	Set the background image in the css not html
	Set the version number on the homepage to be a div not a footer
