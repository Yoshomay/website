* Made the links menu and the br's at the bottom of the page all be loaded in dynamically using /misc.js
* Reformatted the head section and added embeds properly to every page
* Cleaned up the popup code
* Fixed popups going off screen and not being centered on mobile
* Made the popup background blur on all themes
* Made the theme menu behind the popups background
* Reformatted and updated my links page
* Rewrote most of the theme.js file to make it not terrible
* Added readCookie() and setCookie() to make reading and setting cookies far easier (makes me more likely to use them in the future for more things)
