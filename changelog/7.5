* Released the discord server for this and snowy's site, permanent invite link on /index

* Fixed the background color of the alpenglow theme to blend into the image at the top far better
* Added the borders to the grids on the oldreddit theme
* Fixed the background of the goldsrc theme not loading

* Fixed the youtube embedd on /myfursona to be the correct size and width
* Made the width of the grids on /myfursona and /art adjustable
* Made the width of the spacing between the grid's contents 230px instead of the old 250px to reduce wasted horizontal space
* Made the version number on /index a link to /changelog.txt

* Updated /art to also use /myfursona.js
* Changed all the lowres images in /images/yosho/lowres/, images/renders/lowres, and images/renders/bedroomIsometric/lowres/ to remove the _lowres from the filename, so `falke1_lowres.webp` is now `falke1.webp`

* (behind the scenes change but) made the grid elements in /myfursona and /art be created more by the colCreator() function, so if i want to add a new image what before was

```const falke1Div = document.getElementById('falke1');
colCreator(falke1Div, 'images/pfp.png', 'images/pfp.png',`
    This is my pfp by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/hyenapaine" target="_blank">@hyenapaine</a> on Twitter1
    `);```

has now become simply

```colCreator('falke1',
    `This is my pfp by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/hyenapaine" target="_blank">@hyenapaine</a> on Twitter1`
    );```
