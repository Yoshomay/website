					my phone into my pc lol<br><br>

					I unlisted this video because I wasn't happy with how it came out. 
					The main point of hatred was how I straight up didn't include 
					over half of the 1ups. Like good job Yosho.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sNDcLxOuI8&t=18s" target="_blank">
					I did remake the video</a> though.<br><br>
