                -- About My fursona -- <br>
                His name is Yosho because I am Yoshomay and he is Yosho. At the age of 11 he lost <br>
				his parents, and sold his soul at the age of 13 to become magic because why not *shrug*. He started <br>
				out just being a cute with the magic, but nowadays yyyyeah don't trust him <span>&#128064;</span>. He <br>
				will backstab you eventually, but you won't listen to him and will trust him because he <br>
				looks cute. Like I swear to god he'll just rob a bank but frame the employees for it, <br>
				and that's how he makes money as it's against da rules to spawn in money with <br>
				magic. He's green because Yoshi and yellow because green and yellow looks good <br>
				together. He also wears a bandanna occasionally, a rainbow and red bandanna <br>
				depending on how he feels becauase he's gay as hell. I'm homo romantic ace but he's <br>
				just straight up gay.
