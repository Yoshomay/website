                -- About My fursona -- <br>
                His name is Yosho because I am Yoshomay and he is Yosho. At the age of 11 he lost 
				his parents, and sold his soul at the age of 13 to become magic because why not *shrug*. He started 
				out just being a cute with the magic, but nowadays yyyyeah don't trust him <span>&#128064;</span>. He 
				will backstab you eventually, but you won't listen to him and will trust him because he 
				looks cute. Like I swear to god he'll just rob a bank but frame the employees for it, 
				and that's how he makes money as it's against da rules to spawn in money with 
				magic. He's green because Yoshi and yellow because green and yellow looks good 
				together. He also wears a bandanna occasionally, a rainbow and red bandanna 
				depending on how he feels becauase he's gay as hell. I'm homo romantic ace but he's 
				just straight up gay.
