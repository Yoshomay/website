* Made the version number only show up on pc
* Got rid of the active animation for the buttons on mobile
* Made the text on the buttons bold when being hovered over on pc
* Removed the duplicate "help no ideas" in /unlistedvideos
* Renamed /myromhacks to showcase
* Added the pong clone to /showcase
* Made the Links 10px smaller so the bolded text doesn't force buttons down

Made some changes to the code 
	* Put the internal css in /gallery into a new file /gallery.css
	* Made the background color and margin for divs in main.css to apply to all divs
