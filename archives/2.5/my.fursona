                -- About My fursona -- <br>
                His name is Yosho because I am Yoshomay and he is Yosho. At the age of 11 he lost<br> his parents, and sold his soul at the age of 13 to become magic because why not *shrug*. He started<br> out just being a cute with the magic, but nowadays yyyyeah don't trust him :eyes:. He<br> will backstab you eventually, but you won't listen to him and will trust him because he<br> looks cute. Like I swear to god he'll just rob a bank but frame the employees for it,<br> and that's how he makes money as it's against da rules to spawn in money with<br> magic. He's green because Yoshi and yellow because green and yellow looks good<br> together. He also wears a bandanna occasionally, a rainbow and red bandanna<br> depending on how he feels becauase he's gay as hell. I'm homo romantic ace but he's <br> just straight up gay.
